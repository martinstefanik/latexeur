# Dockerized XeLaTeX

An easily customizable, minimal Dockerized version of XeLaTeX on TeX Live 2021 for seamless compilation of TEX files with modern font technologies. As opposed to installing a full TeX Live installation that is too large for many purposes, the image is built from the minimal TeX Live 2021 installation with the addition of commonly used packages.

## Installation 

The application image can be built by executing the following inside the project directory:

```bash
docker build --tag xelatex-docker .
```

## Usage

Given a LaTeX document `trial.tex`, one can compile it as follows:

```bash
docker run \
    --rm \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    --volume "$(pwd):/app" \
    xelatex-docker latexmk -xelatex trial.tex
```

This will ensure that all the files that are generated by `latexmk` persist on the host after the container is (automatically) removed as well as that these files are owned by the current user on the host.

Note also that the quotes in the argument passed to the `--volume` option above are needed in case the current working directory (obtained by `pwd`) contains capital letters or spaces.

The above can also be easily wrapped into a command line application, if necessary.

## Extensions

If the list of installed packages is not satisfactory for the user, it can be easily extended by adding more packages to `packages.txt`. Furthermore, your own custom classes, fonts and packages can be easily added by placing the defining files into the `fonts`, `custom-classes` and `custom-packages` directories, respectively. Hidden files (dot files) in these directories are ignored.

For instance, one could build the application with Source Code Pro font by running:

```bash
wget https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/download/source-code-pro.zip
unzip -d fonts source-code-pro.zip
docker build --tag xelatex-docker
```
